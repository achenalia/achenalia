I'm an EMT turned Software Developer focused on building innovative healthcare solutions to make both patients' and providers' lives easier.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on richRecovery [React, Express, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL], a realtime at-home patient care charting solution designed to allow family members to keep notes on their loved one's recovery progress following a major medical procedure.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I will try to help you as much as I can.
